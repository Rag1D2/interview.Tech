I started this project as part of my 100 Days of Code Challenge
Also, I filmed all of it and you can find the videos on my YouTube Channel

### Day 1

```
FizzBuzz
```

### Day 2

```
String Reversal
```

To see the results of this exercise, open the file (reversed.js) in your IDE,
open your command line using Ctrl + ~

Inside the command line, type

```
node reversed.js
```
