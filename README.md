# Tech Interview Problems - 100 Days of Code

I started this project as part of my 100 Days of Code Challenge
Also, I filmed all of it and you can find the videos on my YouTube Channel
[Here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChXD_e4GZavdnLyzNgSMeyA)

### Day 1

FizzBuzz

- Write a function that takes in a number
- If the number is evenly divisible by 3, replace the number with the word "Fizz"
- If the number is evenly divisible by 5, replace the number with the word "Buzz"
- If the number is evenly divisible by both 3 & 5, replace the number with the word "FizzBuzz"

To see the results of this exercise, open the file (fizzBuzz.js) in your IDE,
open your command line using Ctrl + ~

Inside the command line, type

```
node fizzBuzz.js
```

### Day 2

String Reversal

- Write a function that takes in string, reverses the order of letters in that string and returns the reversed string.

To see the results of this exercise, open the file (reversed.js) in your IDE,
open your command line using Ctrl + ~

Inside the command line, type

```
node reversed.js
```

### Day 3

isPalindrome

- Write a function that takes in a string and then determines if that string is a palindrome (spelled the same, backwards and forwards)

To see the results of this exercise, open the file (palindrome.js) in VS Code, use Ctrl + ~ to open your command line.

Inside the command line, type

```
node palindrome.js
```
